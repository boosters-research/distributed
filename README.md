# Distributed

A federated community API

## Overview

Build federated communities using the same API. Distributed provides a single reusable API for building multiple communities 
on multiple platforms. Whether its for work, social, or anything else, quickly bring up the backend API for it and spin up 
your own frontend experience for it.

## Usage

Distributed is built as a single program in Go.

Just run:

```
go run main.go
```

Your API should start up on `localhost:8080`
